# Tamanna Weather App

This is app is part of a challenge purposed by Tamanna, where I needed to create a Weather App using OpenWeatherMap API. This app was created using React, Next.js, TypeScript, Styled Components and Vercel.

## Features

- [x] Get user's geo location;
- [x] Show current weather, based on user's location (or default location);
- [x] Forecast for the next 7 days;
- [x] User can add and save cities at Locations page;
- [x] User can remove already saved cities from Locations page;
- [x] The list of cities added by the user will persist in order to continue when he leaves and comes back to the app.

## How to run?

Use git to clone this repository

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/brunoalvs/tammana-weather-app.git
